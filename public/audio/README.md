# Audio Files

This directory should contain ambient music files for the reading sessions.

For the MVP, placeholder files are referenced but not included. In a production version, you would add:

- ambient-1.mp3 (30 minutes of cozy reading vibes)
- ambient-2.mp3 (40 minutes of soft focus music)
- ambient-3.mp3 (35 minutes of reading rain sounds)
- ambient-4.mp3 (45 minutes of library whispers)

These should be royalty-free ambient tracks suitable for reading sessions.
